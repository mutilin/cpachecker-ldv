Changes since CPAchecker 1.1
----------------------------
* r4960: If the #include directive of specification automata is used
  with relative paths, the base directory of the relative path is now
  the directory of the file which contains the #include,
  not the CPAchecker root directory.
  If you use #include with relative paths in your own specification files,
  you will probably need to adjust them.
