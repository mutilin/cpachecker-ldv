Changes since CPAchecker 1.1
----------------------------
* r5060: A time limit of 15 minutes is now enabled by default in most configurations.
  If the analysis is not yet finished, CPAchecker will stop after this time and report UNKNOWN.
  The time limit can be controlled with the "cpa.conditions.global.time.wall" option
  and the "-timelimit" command-line argument.
  Example:
  scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis -timelimit 1min test.c
* r4960: If the #include directive of specification automata is used with relative paths, 
  the base directory of the relative path is now the directory of the file which contains the #include,
  not the CPAchecker root directory.
  If #include is used with relative paths in a specification file, it most probably needs adjustment.
