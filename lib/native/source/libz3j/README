Two versions of Z3 are provided, without and with interpolation support.

For using the latter,
libfoci.so needs to be downloaded by the user
(we don't have the rights to redistribute)
and put into the correct directory under CPAchecker/lib/native/...

For building libz3j.so, follow these steps:
- Checkout Z3 from http://z3.codeplex.com
    -> Alternatively, to use the optimization features use the custom branch
       https://bitbucket.org/cheshire/optiz3/
- For interpolation support, get libfoci.so from http://www.kenmcmil.com/foci2/
  (or from Ken McMillan directly) and put it or symlink it into $Z3 and
  $Z3/build (important).
    -> In $Z3, run "python scripts/mk_make.py -f libfoci.so", 
- Alternatively,
    -> in $Z3, run "python scripts/mk_make.py"
- In $Z3/build, run "make" and "strip libz3.so".
- For interpolation support,
    -> Run "./compile.sh $Z3 -interp"
    -> Copy libz3j_interp.so and libz3_interp.so into the correct directory
       under CPAchecker/lib/native/... and commit them.
- Alternatively,
    -> Run "./compile.sh $Z3"
    -> Copy libz3j.so and $Z3/build/libz3.so into the correct directory
       under CPAchecker/lib/native/... and commit them.
