Changes since CPAchecker 1.1
----------------------------
* r4960: If the #include directive of specification automata is used with relative paths, 
  the base directory of the relative path is now the directory of the file which contains the #include,
  not the CPAchecker root directory.
  If #include is used with relative paths in a specification file, it most probably needs adjustment.
