There are several options that are especially useful for benchmarks:

- output.disable=true
  This option disables all output files that would otherwise be
  generated by CPAchecker.

- cpas.symbpredabs.addBranchingInformation=false
  When using predicate analysis, this option prevents adding terms
  to the formulas that are only necessary to generate a better readable
  output of an error path.

It is also recommended to disable assertion checking for benchmarks.
This can be done by removing "-ea" from the last line of scripts/cpa.sh
