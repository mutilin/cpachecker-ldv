/**
 * This class implements a central component that is used for interrupting
 * and stopping a CPAchecker run in case of a timeout or when the user
 * wants to cancel the analysis.
 *
 * It works passively, the running analysis will not be interrupted directly,
 * but instead it has to check every then and now whether it should shutdown.
 * This means that the CPAchecker only halts in "clean" states,
 * never in an intermediate unsafe state,
 * and we can safely do any post-processing (such as statistics printing).
 *
 * The check whether a shutdown was requested is cheap and should be done quite often
 * in order to ensure a timely response to a shutdown request.
 * As a rule of thumb, all operations that may take longer than 1s
 * should take care of calling {@link #shouldShutdown()} or {@link #shutdownIfNecessary()}
 * from time to time.
 *
 * This class supports a hierarchy of instances.
 * Setting the shutdown request on a higher-level instance will do the same in all
 * children instances (recursively), but not vice-versa.
 * This can be used for example to implement global and component-specific timeouts
 * at the same time, with the former overriding the latter if necessary.
 *
 * This class does not implement any timeout by itself.
 * It could do so by checking whether the timeout was reached in
 * {@link #shouldShutdown()}, but this could be expensive when called too often.
 * Instead, a separate component should be used that implements the timeout
 * more intelligently, and uses this class to request a shutdown after the timeout
 * was reached.
 *
 * This class is completely thread safe.
