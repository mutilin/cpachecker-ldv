/**
 * Stop operator for the observer CPA. Returns always true except when
 * the element is bottom.
 *
 * We return true in all cases except bottom because if all other CPAs in
 * the composition return true, then we should also return true to allow
 * the analysis to stop.
 *
 * In the case the element is bottom, we return false to force the bottom
 * element to be stored in the reach set. It will not have any successors
 * because of either the assumption storage CPA, or the fact that its
 * transfer would return an empty set.
 *
 * To test whether an element is bottom, we use the must-stop reporting
 * (mustDumpAssumptionForAvoidance)
