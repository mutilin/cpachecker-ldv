For building libz3j.so, follow these steps:
- Checkout Z3 from http://z3.codeplex.com, using the branch "interp", into a directory $Z3
- Get libfoci.so from http://www.kenmcmil.com/foci2/ (or from Ken McMillan directly)
  and put it or symlink it into $Z3 and $Z3/build (important).
- In $Z3, run "python scripts/mk_make.py -f libfoci.so".
- In $Z3/build, run "make" and "strip libz3.so".
- Run "./compile.sh $Z3" from this directory.
- Copy libz3j.so and $Z3/build/libz3.so into the correct directory under CPAchecker/lib/native/...
  and commit them.

For using Z3 with CPAchecker,
libfoci.so needs to be downloaded by the user
(we don't have the rights to redistribute)
and put into the correct directory under CPAchecker/lib/native/...
