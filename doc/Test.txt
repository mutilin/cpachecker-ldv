Running Unit Tests
------------------

1. Build CPAchecker as described above.
2. You need ant-junit.jar (on Debian/Ubuntu included in the package ant-optional).
3. Run "ant tests" from the project root directory. The output (including the test
   results) will be in test/output/.


Testing Guidelines
------------------

- The folder "test" in the main directory should be used to store (external) regression tests.
  (In old terminology, these would be called integration/system tests.)
  The regression testing script in that directory should execute all system and all unit tests.
- The actual code for the unit tests should go with the code,
  i.e., not in the "test" directory, but besides the code it tests.
  Code for unit tests is like real code.
  If there is a function X, then there can be a function testX.
  If it becomes too cluttered, do what you normally would do: refactor (have a file XTest.java for file X.java).
  If the directory becomes too cluttered, start a new directory.
  But I would start having the test code as close as possible to the code it tests.
- To run JUnit test cases automatically, the name of the class containing the test methods has to end with "Test".
  No other classes should have such a name.
