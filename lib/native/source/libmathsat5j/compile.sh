# This script builds either libmathsat5j.so (bindings to mathsat5), or
# liboptimathsat5j.so (bindings to optimathsat5).
# In future, mathsat5 and optimathsat should merge, making the switching
# obsolete.

# For building libmathsat5j.so, there are two dependencies:
# - The static Mathsat5 library as can be downloaded from http://mathsat.fbk.eu/download.html
# - The static GMP library compiled with the "-fPIC" option.
#   To create this, download GMP from http://gmplib.org/ and run
#   ./configure --enable-cxx --with-pic --disable-shared
#   make

# For building liboptimathsat5.so, OptiMathSat5 can be downloaded from
# http://optimathsat.disi.unitn.it/.

# To build mathsat bindings: ./compile.sh $MATHSAT_DIR $GMP_DIR
# To build optimathsat bindings: ./compile.sh $MATHSAT_DIR $GMP_DIR -opt

# This script searches for all included libraries in the current directory first.
# You can use this to override specific libraries installed on your system.
# You can also use this to force static linking of a specific library,
# if you put only the corresponding .a file in this directory, not the .so file.

# For example, to statically link against libstdc++,
# compile this library with --with-pic,
# and put the resulting libstdc++.a file in this directory.

# This script uses a crude hack to produce downwards-compatible binaries.
# On systems with libc6 >= 2.14, there is a new memcpy function.
# Binaries which link against this function do not work on older systems (e.g., Ubuntu before 12.04)
# We force the linker to use memcpy from libc6 2.2.5 with the following trick:
# 1) Define a wrapper function which just calls memcpy in versions.c.
# 2) Also in versions.c, set the version of memcpy to GLIBC_2.2.5.
# 3) Tell the linker that it should wrap all calls to memcpy with the wrapper function.
# This will need to be extended if there appear other functions in newer a libc
# which are also not downwards compatible.
# Always check with ldd -v what the newest required version of libc and libstdc++ are.
