<!--
  "tool" is the tool to verify.
  All tools for which a corresponding module in scripts/benchmark/tool exists are supported.
  Examples are "cbmc" and "cpachecker".

  "timelimit" is an optional cpu-time limit in seconds.
  "hardtimelimit" is an optional cpu-time limit after which the tool will be killed forcefully
    equal to "timelimit" if not specified).
  "memlimit" is an optional memory limit in megabytes.
  "cpuCores" is an optional number of CPU cores to use per run (otherwise all available cores are used).
  "threads" is the number of parallel executions of verification runs.
  This values can be overriden on the command line when running benchmark.py

  <!--
    There are two important top-level tags:
    <rundefinition>
    <sourcefiles>

    A <rundefinition> tag defines a set of runs of the tool which will be executed
    for all files mentioned in all <sourcefiles> tags.
    Both tags may appear arbitrarily often and
    support an optional attribute "name" in order to distinguish them.

    Inside a <sourcefiles> tag, the tags <include>, <exclude>, and <includesfile>
    may appear. All take a file name (supporting wildcards, variables, etc.) as content.
    <include> and <exclude> may be used to include or exclude files for verification runs directly.
    <includesfile> needs to reference text files which may contain
    further file name patterns (each pattern on one line) of files that will be used for verification.
    All relative paths specified here are relative to the directory of this file.
    Relative paths specified inside a file referenced with <includesfile>
    are relative to the directory of that file.

    Another tag is <option> which defines a command-line argument
    for the verification tool.
    This tag may appear as a top-level tag, inside <rundefinition> tags,
    and inside <sourcefiles> tags, and the argument is used for all files,
    only in the specific set of runs, or only for the specific set of files,
    respectively.
    The tag has a required attribute "name" and optionally takes some text content.

    Both the file name patterns as well as the values of options
    may contain variables in a "${VAR}" syntax that will be replaced by the script.
    This list of allowed variables is:
    benchmark_name
    benchmark_date
    benchmark_path
    benchmark_path_abs
    benchmark_file
    benchmark_file_abs
    rundefinition_name
    logfile_path
    logfile_path_abs
    sourcefile_name
    sourcefile_path
    sourcefile_path_abs
    C.f. benchmark-cpachecker.xml for an example of variable usage.

    Furthermore, a <columns> tag may appear as a top-level tag
    with a list of <column> tags inside. The script will then try to find values
    for the specified columns in the output of the verification tool.
    This is currently only supported for CPAchecker
    and not guaranteed to be supported in the future at all.
    C.f. benchmark-cpachecker.xml for an example.

    There are three more top-level tags that are used only when the verifier cloud is used:

    <requiredfiles> can be used to specify additional files that are needed
    for executing the benchmark. The tag may contain a path to a file or directory
    that is transmitted to the worker. Wildcards, environment variables etc. are resolved.
    The tag may appear several times.

    <require> can be used to select a specific set of worker machines. The attributes
    "cpuModel" (giving a string that needs to be contained in the worker's CPU name),
    "cpuCores" (giving the minimal number of CPU cores), and
    "memory" (giving the minimal amount of memory in MB) can be specified (all optional).
    The tag may appear several times, but each attribute may appear at most once
    (so you can specify all attributes in a single tag or spread over several occurrences).

    <resultfiles> can be used to specify a file-name pattern matching all the result
    files created by the tool that should be transported back after executing the run
    from the worker to the user's machine.
