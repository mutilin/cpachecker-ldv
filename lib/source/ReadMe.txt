This directory contains source code of libraries that are under development and
CPAchecker needs to use development versions.

As soon as a stable and sufficient development version of the library is known,
the revision number should be fixed in the record of svn:externals.

As soon as a stable release version of the library is available,
the library should be removed from here and retrieved as binary via Ivy.
