CPAchecker Installation

Installing CPAchecker
---------------------

1. Install Java 1.6 SDK or higher (OpenJDK 6 works, too).
   http://java.sun.com/
2. Checkout CPAchecker from SVN repository.
   URL: https://svn.sosy-lab.org/software/cpachecker/trunk
   URL (read-only mirror): http://cpachecker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
3. Install ant (anything since version 1.6 should be ok).
   The optional ant tasks are needed (in Ubuntu they are packaged as ant-optional).
4. Run "ant" in CPAchecker directory to build CPAchecker.

Installing CPAchecker as Eclipse Plugin for C projects
------------------------------------------------------

1. You need Eclipse 3.5 with CDT 6 or Eclipse 3.6 with CDT 7.
2. Add the URL http://www.sosy-lab.org/~dbeyer/eclipse-download/ as an update site to Eclipse.
3. Install CPAclipse plugin.


Developing CPAchecker from within Eclipse
-----------------------------------------

1. Install Eclipse 3.5 or 3.6 with JDT.
   http://www.eclipse.org/
2. Install an SVN plugin for Eclipse, e.g. SubClipse (http://subclipse.tigris.org,
   Eclipse update site: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x)
   Create new project from SVN repository
   URL: https://svn.sosy-lab.org/software/cpachecker/trunk
   URL (read-only mirror): http://cpachecker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
3. Ignore warnings "Unsatisfied version constraint: 'org.eclipse.cdt.core ...'"
   and "Bundle 'org.eclipse.cdt.core' cannot be resolved'".
4. In order to run CPAchecker, use one of the supplied launch configurations
   or create your own.
   To select the configuration, specification, and program files use the
   text box "program arguments" in the launch configuration editor.
   Step 8 of the section "Running CPAchecker" above describes what can be entered here.
   The text box "VM arguments" needs to contain "-Djava.library.path=lib/native/<ENVIRONMENT>",
   where <ENVIRONMENT> is replaced with one of the following depending on your system:
   		x86_64-linux, x86-linux, x86_64-macosx, x86-macosx,  x86-win32
5. Optional: If you want to work with the source of Eclipse CDT, download
   http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/indigo/plugins/org.eclipse.cdt.core.source_5.3.1.201109151620.jar
   and put it into the lib/eclipse/ folder.

Developing CPAchecker as Eclipse Plugin for C projects
------------------------------------------------------

1. Requires Eclipse 3.5 with CDT 6 or Eclipse 3.6 with CDT 7
   and the Eclipse Plugin Development Environment.
   If you have CDT 6, you need the package "Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools SDK"
   (Eclipse update site: http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/galileo).
   If you have CDT 7, you need the package "Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools".
   Also install an SVN plugin, e.g. SubClipse (see above).
2. Create an Eclipse project for CPAchecker as described above.
3. Create an Eclipse project for CPAclipse from the SVN repository
   URL: https://svn.sosy-lab.org/software/cpachecker/trunk/plugin/CPAclipse
4. If there are warnings about missing bundles, you don't have CDT in the correct version.
5. Run the CPAclipse project as an "Eclipse Application".
