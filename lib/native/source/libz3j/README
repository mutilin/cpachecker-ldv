Shared object file for Z3 is bundled together with CPAchecker.

For building libz3j.so, follow these steps:
- Checkout Z3 from http://z3.codeplex.com
- Switch to the "opt" branch.
- Run "python scripts/mk_make.py"
- Switch to the "build" directory, run "make" and "strip libz3.so".
- From this folder:
    -> Run "./buildZ3wrapper $Z3PATH/src/api"
    -> Run "./compile.sh $Z3PATH"
    -> Copy libz3j.so and $Z3/build/libz3.so into the correct directory
       under CPAchecker/lib/native/... and commit them.
